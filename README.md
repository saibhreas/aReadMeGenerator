## Purpose

Use Node JS to create a Command Line Interface (CLI) App that writes the initial format for a README.md file, a **ReadME File Generator**.  
App should be general enough for almost any app or modul.  App makes ReadMe.md files that demonstrate style, level of professionalism, readable, and informative.

The criteria were set by the Rutgers Fullstack program in assignment #9
